<h3>Simple Template Engine</h3>
<p>The Simple Template Engine is a short and simple template engine I built in JS that targets a page that's already running jQuery. My inspiration came from a <a href="http://stephenwalther.com/archive/2010/11/30/an-introduction-to-jquery-templates">blog post by Stephen Walther titled "An Introduction to jQuery Templates"</a>. I enjoyed the simple syntax and had an idea as to how I could make a considerably powerful templatting engine in a small amount of code. That code can be found on my github page found <a href="https://github.com/mikebald/Simple-Template-Engine">here</a> or you can view the source for this page and grab the template.js file.</p>
